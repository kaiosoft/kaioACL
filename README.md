# kaioACL
Kaio ACL developed from framework Code Igniter 2.13. Created with the aim to facilitate and cut the time of making the application.

You can always make your own modifications if needed to, since the software is open source, but I'll recommend that you share your modifications with us here at GitHub, so we can get your modification as part of the main application. If you have ideas to new features or have experienced some bugs, please create an issue about it, and I will take a look at it.
